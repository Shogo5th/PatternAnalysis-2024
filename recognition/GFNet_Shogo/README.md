# GFNet for Alzheimer's Disease Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying Alzheimer's disease using the ADNI brain data. The model implemented is based on the **GFNet** vision transformer architecture, aiming to achieve a minimum accuracy of 0.8 on the test dataset. This project is part of the PatternAnalysis repository and is designed to contribute to the field of medical image classification.

## Problem Description

The goal of this project is to classify brain scans from the ADNI dataset as either normal or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The classification task leverages one of the latest vision transformers, GFNet, to effectively analyze and predict the outcome based on medical imaging data.
